        <div class="section">
            <h2>Definition of Halal</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                <strong>Halal</strong> is an Arabic word meaning "permissible" or "allowed."
                In the context of food and drink, halal refers to what Muslims are allowed to eat and drink
                according to Islamic religious guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of halal as similar to kosher in Judaism - it's a set of religious dietary rules.
                The concept covers not just what is consumed, but also how food is prepared, processed,
                and handled. For Muslims in the UK, following halal guidelines is an important part of their faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key principles of halal include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prohibited foods:</strong> Pork and pork products, alcohol, blood, carnivorous animals (like lions or dogs), and animals not slaughtered according to Islamic rules</li>
                <li><strong>Cleanliness and hygiene:</strong> Food must be prepared in clean conditions, without contact with prohibited substances</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical treatment:</strong> Animals must be treated humanely and the slaughter process must minimize suffering</li>
                <li><strong>Religious blessing:</strong> The person slaughtering must be Muslim and say a prayer invoking God's name during the process</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> The interpretation and strictness of halal standards can vary among different
                Muslim communities, scholars, and certification bodies. This diversity reflects different schools of Islamic
                thought and personal levels of religious practice.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Halal Meat</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Halal meat refers to meat from animals that have been slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines.
                This is one of the most significant aspects of halal dietary laws.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirements for Halal Slaughter</h3>
            <p>For meat to be considered halal, the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The animal must be permitted:</strong> Allowed animals include cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, and other poultry. Pork and carnivorous animals are not allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>The slaughterer must be Muslim:</strong> The person performing the slaughter must be of sound mind and must be a Muslim (or in some interpretations, a Christian or Jewish person).</li>
                <li><strong>Religious blessing:</strong> God's name must be invoked at the time of slaughter by saying a prayer (such as "In the name of God, God is the Greatest").</li>
                <li><strong>Method of slaughter:</strong> A swift, deep cut must be made with a sharp knife across the throat, cutting the jugular veins, carotid arteries, windpipe, and food pipe, while leaving the spinal cord intact. This method is designed to cause rapid unconsciousness and minimize suffering.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood drainage:</strong> The blood must be completely drained from the body, as consumption of blood is forbidden in Islam.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal welfare:</strong> The animal must be alive and healthy at the time of slaughter and must not witness other animals being slaughtered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Stunning Debate</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most debated topics in halal meat in the UK is <strong>pre-slaughter stunning</strong>.
                Some certification bodies accept certain forms of stunning (such as light electrical stunning) if it
                renders the animal unconscious but not dead, arguing this reduces suffering. Others require
                non-stunned slaughter, maintaining this is the only authentic Islamic method.
            </p>
            <p>
                This difference in approach is a major factor in why there are different halal standards and certification
                bodies operating in the UK, each catering to different interpretations within the Muslim community.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Halal Certification Bodies in the UK</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                The UK has several halal certification bodies, each with slightly different standards and methodologies.
                Understanding these differences helps consumers make informed choices aligned with their level of observance.

                <strong>Note:</strong> When shopping or dining out, it's important to check which certification body
                has approved a product or establishment, as standards can vary. Many Muslims prefer HMC certification
                for meat products due to their strict no-stunning policy.

                <strong>Important Understanding:</strong> There is no single "correct" level of observance. Islamic scholars
                from different schools of thought have varying opinions on these matters. What's most important is that
                each Muslim makes informed choices based on their understanding of Islam, their personal circumstances,
                and their conscience. Mutual respect for different levels of observance within the community is essential.

                <strong>Practical Advice:</strong> When dining out or shopping, look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear halal certification displayed (check which body certified it)</li>
                <li>Ask staff about their halal standards and certification</li>
                <li>Inquire about cross-contamination prevention measures</li>
                <li>Check if stunning is used in meat slaughter if this concerns you</li>
                <li>Use halal restaurant apps and directories that specify certification details</li>
            </ul>
